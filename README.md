<!-- This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.

You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.

You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.

Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration. -->
